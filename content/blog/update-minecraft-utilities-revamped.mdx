## Unveiling the Latest Enhancements to the Minecraft Utilities Bot!

We're excited to introduce a suite of new features and updates for the Minecraft Utilities Bot that will elevate your Minecraft experience to new heights. Our latest update focuses on improving usability, enhancing visual appeal, and adding powerful new functionalities. Here's a deep dive into what's new:

### Revamped Java & Bedrock Commands

Our Java and Bedrock commands have undergone a significant overhaul. With the updated commands, you'll now receive comprehensive server information, including:

- **Server Location:** Know exactly where your server is hosted.
- **Timezone:** Understand the server's local time zone.
- **Hosting Company:** Identify the provider hosting your server.

This detailed information ensures you're fully informed about your server's operational details, making management easier and more transparent.

### Sleek and Modern Command Response UI

We've given our command response UI a complete makeover! The new design is modern, intuitive, and visually appealing, featuring a clean layout and the addition of emojis. This not only makes the responses easier to read but also adds a touch of fun to your interactions with the bot.

### Introducing the Info Command

Say goodbye to multiple commands for different queries! Our new `/info` command consolidates all item queries into one powerful command. Now, you can easily find information on various categories with a single command:

`/info <category> <item name>`


**Available Categories:**
- Enchantments
- Blocks
- Mobs
- Effects
- Foods
- Items

Moreover, you no longer need to remember specific Minecraft IDs like `oak_wood`. You can simply type `oak wood`, and the bot will understand your query.

### New Watchdog Command for Hypixel

For Hypixel players, we’ve added the `/watchdog` command, providing insights into the server's ban statistics. This command offers:

- **Last Minute Bans:** See bans that occurred in the last minute.
- **Total Bans:** View the total number and percentage of bans by Watchdog and Hypixel staff.
- **Daily Bans:** Get daily ban counts for both Watchdog and staff.

This detailed ban information helps you stay informed about the server’s moderation activities.

### Real-Time Server Stats with Javachannel and Bedrockchannel Commands

Monitoring your server stats has never been easier. With the new `/javachannel` and `/bedrockchannel` commands, you can create a category with channels that display your server's statistics in real-time, updating every 5 minutes. These stats include:

- **Online Players:** See how many players are currently online.
- **Max Players:** Know the maximum player capacity.
- **Server Version:** Check the version of your server.

**Usage:**
- `/javachannel <address>`
- `/bedrockchannel <address>`

This feature ensures you always have the latest information about your server at your fingertips.

### Updated Profile Command

Our profile command has received a visual upgrade. The new UI is sleek and modern, providing a more engaging and user-friendly experience. Whether you're checking your stats or viewing your profile details, the new design ensures a smooth and pleasant interaction.

### Now Using TypeScript

In our commitment to improving the bot's performance and maintainability, we've transitioned from JavaScript to TypeScript. This change enhances code quality, ensures better type safety, and facilitates easier debugging, leading to a more robust and reliable bot.

These updates are designed to enhance your Minecraft experience, making server management more straightforward and interactions more enjoyable. We invite you to explore these new features and share your feedback with us!

Happy Crafting!
